# Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Portfolio

A React + Vite + TypeScript portfolio with a Pokemon Red Mystery Dungeon inspired, pixel-forward aesthetic. Built to showcase freelance readiness with sections for summary, projects, and contact.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm (or your preferred package manager)

## Setup
Because PowerShell commands are disabled in your environment, run these in a different shell (Command Prompt or Git Bash):
1. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install`
2. Start the dev server:
   - `npm run dev`
3. Lint and typecheck:
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run typecheck`
4. Build for production:
   - `npm run build`

## Available Scripts
- `dev` – start Vite dev server
- `build` – production build
- `preview` – preview the production build
- `lint` – run ESLint
- `typecheck` – TypeScript type checking

## Project Sections
- **Hero / Summary**: Highlights services, vibe, and capabilities.
- **Quest Log (Projects)**: Cards with status, description, and tech stack.
- **Contact**: Links for LinkedIn, Gmail, and GitHub.

## Theming Notes
- Palette pulls from red, gold, and deep brown to mirror classic Mystery Dungeon scenes.
- Pixel-inspired grid, glow, and badge styling for retro flavor.

## Next Steps
- Replace placeholder project links and email with your actual URLs.
- Add more projects or case studies as you ship them.
- Run `git init` and make your first commit once you have shell access.
- Connect to your hosting of choice (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) and set the build command to `npm run build` with output `dist`.
